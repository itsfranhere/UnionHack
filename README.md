##UnionHack

###Flag Design & Graphic Design Project for *Fundamentals of Web Design*.

By Francisco & Jose.

Union Hack consisted in mashing up a flag of our election and then designing a flag of our own. Following the brief and after watching *Ted Kaye* intervention in TedEx, we figured how our flags should be designed like:

*	Keep it simple. *For a child to draw from memory*

*	Use meaningful symbolism. *The flag should relate to what it represents*

*	Use 2 or 3 basic colours.

* 	No lettering or seals.

*	Be distinctive or be related.

##Francisco:

I chose the France flag. I choose this flag because of its simplicity, and for this reason I thought it would be easier to experiment different patterns, colours or even defragmentation.

France Flag

For further knowledge, I started by doing some research about its historical content to know where to start investing at first place, so that I could do something more consistent and solid.

During the entire process I did a few variations with several colours, trying to get different shapes and manipulate them as much as possible. Then I did some sketches until I reached the final product.

One of the goals was to end with something simple that could show the entire beauty of the flag.

###Own Flag

When choosing my own flag, I looked for a landscape that had a range of different visual aspects to represent them into a flag.

Landscape chosen

I did some sketches around symbols and played as much I could with the atmosphere and history behind it to have something simple and engaging at the same time.

I tried different colours, different shapes to obtain something meaningful and consistent in each variation, achieving this way the final product.

Variation 2

I planned my lesson from the analyse of the brief to the final implementation for a continuous process.Â The main key points were the transformation I gave to each flag which gave a different purpose for each context, respecting all the principles.



##Jose:

For the Mash-up I chose my hometown, Mieres flag, as after some research there were many flags from countries that I liked, I ended up searching for my town's one, and found it funny I had never seen it before so I decided to give it a try.

*Mieres Flag*

I researched a bit of the flag's background and found that the colours represent the peace and the people by the white fringe, the water in the river (very important for the town) by the blue, and the richness of its ground (Mieres has a miner and metal building long background) by the bottom yellow fringe. 
In terms of design, the flag meets almost all the requirements as it has three basic colours, easy to remind, representative of the town...

I made a first approach and after some sketches this is what I finished with:

*Variation 4*

After the first feedback session we discussed the possibilities we had to make the symbolism simpler, making the flat meet all the rules for a good design:

###Own Flag

To design my own flag, I decided to look for a landscape I liked and try and get all the elements of it into a flag that would represent it.

*Landscape chosen*

I made some sketches for the symbolism and tried to play with Switzerland, Sweden and South Africa flags, first two because of their medieval looking, and South Africa because the math relation of the shapes. 
This is the final result:
