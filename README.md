##UnionHack

###Flag Design & Graphic Design Project for *Fundamentals of Web Design*.

By Francisco & Jose.

Union Hack consisted in mashing up a flag of our election and then designing a flag of our own. Following the brief and after watching *Ted Kaye* intervention in TedEx, we figured how our flags should be designed like:

*	Keep it simple. *For a child to draw from memory*

*	Use meaningful symbolism. *The flag should relate to what it represents*

*	Use 2 or 3 basic colours.

* 	No lettering or seals.

*	Be distinctive or be related.

##Francisco:

We chose the France flag.

We chose this flag by its simplicity, so I thought I could add something more valuable and take the most of it.

I started by doing some variations, trying different shapes, playing with lots of colours and manipulate them. Then I did some sketches until reached the final product.

##Jose:

For the Mash-up I chose my hometown, Mieres flag, as after some research there were many flags from countries that I liked, I ended up searching for my town's one, and found it funny I had never seen it before so I decided to give it a try.

*Mieres Flag*

I researched a bit of the flag's background and found that the colours represent the peace and the people by the white fringe, the water in the river (very important for the town) by the blue, and the richness of its ground (Mieres has a miner and metal building long background) by the bottom yellow fringe. 
In terms of design, the flag meets almost all the requirements as it has three basic colours, easy to remind, representative of the town...

I made a first approach and after some sketches this is what I finished with:

*Variation 4*

After the first feedback session we discussed the possibilities we had to make the symbolism simpler, making the flat meet all the rules for a good design:

###Own Flag

To design my own flag, I decided to look for a landscape I liked and try and get all the elements of it into a flag that would represent it.

*Landscape chosen*

I made some sketches for the symbolism and tried to play with Switzerland, Sweden and South Africa flags, first two because of their medieval looking, and South Africa because the math relation of the shapes. 
This is the final result:
